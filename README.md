# Basketball-shots-game-bot

A game of basketball in which one the player who would have scored the most basket in two minutes would have won a reward had been published on internet in 2023.

As the game was a bit hard to play on our phone, I tried to automate the throws of the ball in the bucket which was moving from the left to the right of the screen.

By automating these basketball throws, I discovered a lot of new methods used in Python, in particular regarding detection of objects, shapes and colors, which you can see in the code.

I finally haven't won the challenge, but it was exciting trying to make bucket automatically without even moving my mouse :) 

(I won't add any pictures/videos of the website in case of cheat accusing, even if I haven't used it to cheat as I didn't win)
